## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Web-first workflow


### What I learned

I've learnt how to centre a div with margins.
I'm also learning how to use my eye to judge the margins, padding and font-size of the design.

Here is how you can centre a div using margins, Please note the css property must always have a width assigned to it otherwise it won't work.
```HTML
<div class="container">
    <h3>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h3>
    <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
</div>
```
```css
.container{
  width: 250px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```
This leaves you with all your work centre. NOTE: This only works with display: block; however much i didnt add it because by default display is block.


### Continued development

I'd love to learn more about Flexbox and Grid. Then alot of other css properties.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://www.googlefonts.com) - This helped me with getting the font off the internet.
